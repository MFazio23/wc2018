## Team Distribution
Teams are distributed in parties randomly, based on criteria set by the party owner.  Owners choose from three ranking systems (FIFA Rankings, FiveThirtyEight's SPI Rankings, and a random ranking) as well as how many teams each player is assigned.

## Privacy
Normally, this would some huge blob of legalese that nobody would read.

Instead, as I'm a developer, this is going to be basic.

The only personal info I get from the site your email address and name (when you log in with a third-party service.)
Your email address allows me to connect accounts across Google, Facebook, and Twitter into a single account.
Your name allows me to display it for the site/app and any groups.

I am using Google Analytics to get metrics on the site.  If this makes you uncomfortable, feel free to block it.
I'm just looking for numbers and to see if anyone cares about this thing.

Past that, I don't get any personal info nor do I want it.

## Terms of Service
WWC2019 is just for fun, should be free, and has no attached warranty.

Again, this is in no way officially associated with FIFA or the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™.
