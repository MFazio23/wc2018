                        Normally, this would some huge blob of legalese that nobody would read.<br />
                        <br />
                        Instead, as I'm a developer, this is going to be basic.<br />
                        <br />
                        The only personal info I get from the site your email address and name (when you log in with a third-party service.)<br />
                        Your email address allows me to connect accounts across Google, Facebook, and Twitter into a single account.<br />
                        Your name allows me to display it for the site/app and any groups.<br />
                        <br />
                        I am using Google Analytics to get metrics on the site.  If this makes you uncomfortable, feel free to block it.<br />
                        I'm just looking for numbers and to see if anyone cares about this thing.<br/>
                        <br />
                        Past that, I don't get any personal info nor do I want it.<br />
